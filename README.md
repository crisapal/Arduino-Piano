# Arduino-Piano
Arduino- I2C - Master Slave 
In order to understand how powerful a microcontroller could be, I tried to develop a mini-piano using 2 arduino (mega 2560 and UNO).

STEPS:

1. Building the piano with 8 buttons and a buzzer
2. Trying to practice Master-Slave connection between my Arduino devices
